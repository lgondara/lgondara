Hi, I am Lovedeep Gondara. I am a Biostatistician/Data Scientist at BC Cancer. I received my PhD from Simon Fraser University, advised by Prof. Ke Wang. My main research interests include privacy-preserving machine learning (deep learning), applications of large language models to resource constrained domains, multimodal machine learning, and (bio)statistics. My current research is primarily focused on applications of my research interests to healthcare.
