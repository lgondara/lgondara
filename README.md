Hi, I am Lovedeep Gondara. I am a Research Scientist (Machine Learning) at Provincial Health Services Authority(BC). I received my PhD from Simon Fraser University, advised by Prof. Ke Wang. My main research interests include privacy-preserving machine learning (deep learning), applications of large language models to healthcare and resource constrained domains, multimodal machine learning, and (bio)statistics. My current research is primarily focused on applications of my research interests to healthcare.
