Hi, I am Lovedeep Gondara. I am a Research Scientist (Machine Learning) and AI team lead at Provincial Health Services Authority (British Columbia). I received my PhD from Simon Fraser University. My main research interests include privacy-preserving machine learning (deep learning), large and small language models, their applications to various domains and making them work in resource constrained settings, and multimodal machine learning. My current research is primarily focused on language models and privacy-preserving machine learning.
