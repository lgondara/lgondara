Hi, I am Lovedeep Gondara. I am a PhD student at Simon Fraser Universityâ€™s database and data mining lab where I am supervised by Prof. Ke Wang and I am a biostatistician at BC Cancer. My main research interests are in Machine Learning (especially Deep Learning), Statistics, and the intersection of both with their real world applications. My current research is primarily focused on privacy preserving machine learning and machine learning in healthcare.
